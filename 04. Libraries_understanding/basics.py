- Collection of codes and resources that has alot of functionand operations already written for us
- similar to a manufacture developed by open source developer 
- Python Packages are pre made scripty 
- Use in day to day and can't be code from scratch 
- Documentation are instructions 
- Google package and then go to the actual documentaion and read the whole documentation 
- Hover to get details
- Tensorflow, Pytorch, keras, numpy, pandas, sklearn etc
- If a lib exist it is foolish to code from scratch
- Not all packages are directly installed with python, if they were install with python then there won't be enough memory
- Research about the libraries also 
- Those lib which comes with python are called preinstalled libraries. Others are to be installed by us
- pip instal to install lib
- pip is the package manager
- cmd + j to activate terminal
- Installing packages
