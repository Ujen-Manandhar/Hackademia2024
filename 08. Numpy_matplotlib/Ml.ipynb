    "<p>Deep learning is a subset of ANN; and follow artectucture of ANN; the main difference between Ml and Deep learning is in ML input needs to be proper only integer or text (5), in Dl and ANN input needs not to be proper can be audio, symbol, image, anything of the number (5). Dl is more complex as algo are very hard</p>\n",

Telling a baby by showing a duster and marker and telling the baby what they are and the baby can classiy by themself after various showing of the duster and marker.The dataset only take space. Dataset heavy model only save state. </p>\n",

And baby only understands the featurs and group the object. In such learning we don't give output only the dataset. Understans that the object that are similar are to be grouped together.</p>\n",

An agent and enviroment to seperate the input and if done properly then reward otherwise punishment. Done with game bots where death is bad and kill is good. Used with Tesla car. only save state so save only write part.</p>"
