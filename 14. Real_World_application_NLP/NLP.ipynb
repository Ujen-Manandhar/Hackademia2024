    "<p>Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a branch of Ai that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves the ability of a computer tor understand, interpret and generate human language in a valuable way. Computer understanding our day to day language like english.</p>\n",

    "<p>We were first checking strings and this has restriction this causes problem as a person can't write all the rules (condition), ie rule based method. Too many if condition. Ie not ai as in ai makes its own rule. NLP came because we can't write all the rules. Chat gpt is a NLP process.GPT understand the sentences and breakdown the sentence and understands the nuances of text and from the data it has it organizes the output through NLP and gives output. </p>"

    "<p>Text processing is the foundation of NLP. We ogten need to clean and prepare text data before appling more complex models. Here are some basic text processing techniques. NLP has two ways from model training through Sklearn or tensor flow. This takes a lot of time as to understand text nuances(eat and ate, sleep or slept). Due to this simple task becomes difficult if we process the text a little for these nuances to their bare minium and isolate words, and remove unneeded stop words, period , comma. So to make the work bare minium. makes the processing easy </p>\n",
