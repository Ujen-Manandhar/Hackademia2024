    "<p>Classification on the other hand tells if the given the data the output belong to a certain class or not. Class can be anything ie Labels if a vehicle has 4 wheels and a stering wheel it belongs to the class of car. Also gives the accuracy from confunsion matrix. Classification has various algorithm. Like logistic regression, K- nearest(KNN), SVM, Decision Tree, Random forest. After we cover all regression and classification then we can say we have learned all AI in the world. As sometimes there is regression and sometime classification and in other cases both like in GAN, Diffusion model (regression gives the coordinates of image) after ploting the cordinates then we go to classification to check if the image is right or wrong (if wrong then the regression model continously improves).</p>\n",
    "<p>Assigning the class is classification, ie where the output lies depending upon the features. eg: If an image of snake is given assign the class reptile or mammal depending upon the features(data); if the model gives the detail of the snake then it is regression(continous values). For classifying/choosing values then classification(discrete)</p>\n",

    "<p>Regression predicts continous value of constilation(stars). First we have the real image and then a generated image from regression and put inside the discriminiator(classifier) and which sees if the two images are similar or not with output Y/N. If two images are similar then the classifier says Y but if N then the regression model becomes better. As it is supervised learning we can also say no or yes to the classifier to make the classifier better if the ans is different from the ground truth. Here in GAN the regression modell makes the classifier better and the classifier makes the regression better. Regression model tries to fool the classifier by saying it's the orginal image and classifier tries to become better. With symbotic relationship both become better.</p>"

Classification is used every where eg; auto driving car to classifiy what is what in the roads like cars, bike , pedistrians. and depending upon the classification it determises to go stop, go slowly. So, basically classification trains itself on features then depending upon the input the model defines a set of rules and gives output of a class for the input given and finalizes it </p>\n",
